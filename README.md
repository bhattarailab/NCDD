Landscape of clinical procedures in gastrointestinal vision. Orange: Unassisted, a doctor has to assess all patientsâ€™ data tediously and redundantly. Blue: Artificial Intelligence can help in the classification of known or seen diseases but makes misleading assumptions and often overconfident predictions on images when it faces real-world examples consisting of examples that it had never seen. Green: A combination of human intervention and OOD enabled the AI method to improve efficacy in the current scenario, where a specialist intervenes to correct any unseen or unknown instances that the AI model is uncertain in classifying.
